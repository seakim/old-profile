# selfchallenge1

A quick new project to challenge myself with responsive CSS

## How to install

navigate to where the project was installed

type `npm install` into the console (This will install this projects dependencies, ignore any security warnings for now, this isn't a production server so it will not expose your computer or data so long as you have a good firewall)

type `npm install -g node-sass gulp gulp-sass` into the console (This will install the developer's dependencies on a global scope)
